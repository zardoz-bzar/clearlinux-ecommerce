Integrating Ecom Stacks with ClearLinux with a Focus on Cloud Hosting

ClearLinux isn't just for HPC users doing Tensorflows that have Vulcan brains or Desktop users who want to brag about their benchmarks.

ClearLinux maximizes public cloud spend by allowing you to optimally use Intel hardware for crypto functions, math operations, memory operations, and generally most things due to aggressive but safe optimization.

This repo will be a mix of documentation and scripts for integrating the stateless nature of ClearLinux with the default swapless nature of public cloud hosting.
